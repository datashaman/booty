1. grep -n "promotion_waiting_reviewer" src/booty/verifier/runner.py to confirm presence.
2. Read surrounding context: this should log when tests_passed but can_promote is False due to Reviewer not yet success.
3. Add to docs/capabilities-summary.md under Verifier Agent section (after "Publishes the booty/verifier GitHub check."): "When tests pass but Reviewer has not yet succeeded, Verifier logs promotion_waiting_reviewer (OPS-04)."
