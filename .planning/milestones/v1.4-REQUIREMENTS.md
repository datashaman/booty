# Requirements: Booty v1.4 Release Governor

**Defined:** 2026-02-16
**Core Value:** A Builder agent that can take a GitHub issue and produce a working PR with tested code — the foundation everything else builds on.

## v1.4 Requirements (This Milestone)

Requirements for Release Governor agent. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Trigger & Inputs

- [x] **GOV-01**: Governor runs when a verification workflow completes successfully on main (workflow_run event, conclusion=success, head_sha)
- [x] **GOV-02**: Governor uses head_sha from event payload (never "latest main")
- [x] **GOV-03**: Governor receives optional Observability signal "is production degraded" (in-process state or Sentry; default unknown)
- [x] **GOV-04**: Governor loads config from env + optional .booty.yml; env overrides .booty.yml; strict schema (unknown keys fail)

### Decision & Risk

- [x] **GOV-05**: Governor computes risk_class (LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH) from paths touched vs production_sha
- [x] **GOV-06**: HIGH risk: workflow dirs, infra, auth-sensitive, lockfiles, migrations (configurable pathspecs)
- [x] **GOV-07**: MEDIUM risk: dependency manifests without lockfiles
- [x] **GOV-08**: Hard holds: deploy not configured; first deploy without approval (when required); degraded + high-risk
- [x] **GOV-09**: LOW risk: auto-ALLOW if Verifier passed and no active incident
- [x] **GOV-10**: MEDIUM risk: ALLOW if no incident; else HOLD
- [x] **GOV-11**: HIGH risk: HOLD unless operator approval exists (environment | label | comment)
- [x] **GOV-12**: Cooldown: no re-deploy of same SHA within N minutes after failure (default 30)
- [x] **GOV-13**: Rate limit: max M deploys per hour (default 6)

### Deploy Trigger & Post-Deploy

- [x] **GOV-14**: On ALLOW: dispatch deploy workflow via workflow_dispatch with sha=input
- [x] **GOV-15**: On HOLD: emit explanation (status or issue) with reason code and unblock instructions
- [x] **GOV-16**: Governor observes deploy outcome (workflow_run or deployment_status)
- [x] **GOV-17**: On deploy failure: create/append GitHub issue with deploy-failure, severity:high, link to Actions run
- [x] **GOV-18**: Governor never deploys a SHA that wasn't the verifier head_sha

### Persistence & Idempotency

- [x] **GOV-19**: Release state store: production_sha_current, production_sha_previous, last_deploy_attempt_sha, last_deploy_time, last_deploy_result, last_health_check
- [x] **GOV-20**: Store in file (.booty/state/release.json or similar); atomic writes; survives restarts
- [x] **GOV-21**: Dedup at (repo, head_sha); delivery ID caching for idempotency
- [x] **GOV-22**: Never trigger deploy twice for same SHA

### Operator UX

- [x] **GOV-23**: HOLD message: Decision, SHA, Risk, Reason code, "How to unblock"
- [x] **GOV-24**: ALLOW message: Decision, SHA, "Triggered: deploy workflow run &lt;link&gt;"
- [x] **GOV-25**: Single consistent UX pattern (commit status `booty/release-governor` OR issue comment — pick one)

### Config Schema

- [x] **GOV-26**: release_governor.enabled, production_environment_name, require_approval_for_first_deploy
- [x] **GOV-27**: release_governor.high_risk_paths, migration_paths (pathspecs)
- [x] **GOV-28**: release_governor.deploy_workflow_name, deploy_workflow_ref, cooldown_minutes, max_deploys_per_hour
- [x] **GOV-29**: release_governor.approval_mode (environment | label | comment); approval_label / approval_command when applicable

### Deliverables

- [x] **GOV-30**: New agent module `release_governor`
- [x] **GOV-31**: docs/release-governor.md (config, approval, troubleshooting, manual test steps)
- [x] **GOV-32**: CLI: `booty governor status`, `booty governor simulate --sha <sha>`, `booty governor trigger --sha <sha>`
