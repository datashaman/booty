# Requirements: Booty (v1.3)

**Defined:** 2026-02-15
**Core Value:** A Builder agent that can take a GitHub issue and produce a working PR with tested code — the foundation everything else builds on.

## v1.3 Requirements (Observability)

### Deploy Automation

- [x] **DEPLOY-01**: GitHub Actions workflow triggers on push to main branch ✓
- [x] **DEPLOY-02**: Workflow SSHs to DigitalOcean server and runs deploy.sh (or equivalent) ✓
- [x] **DEPLOY-03**: Deployment restarts Booty service (systemctl) after pulling and installing ✓

### Sentry APM

- [x] **APM-01**: Sentry SDK integrated with FastAPI app; errors and exceptions captured ✓
- [x] **APM-02**: Release set to git SHA (or equivalent) for deploy correlation ✓
- [x] **APM-03**: Environment tag set (e.g., production) for filtering in Sentry UI ✓

### Observability Agent

- [x] **OBSV-01**: Observability agent exposes POST webhook route for Sentry alerts ✓
- [x] **OBSV-02**: Webhook verifies Sentry-Hook-Signature via HMAC-SHA256 before processing ✓
- [x] **OBSV-03**: Filter by configurable severity threshold (e.g., error and above) ✓
- [x] **OBSV-04**: Deduplicate by error fingerprint (one issue per unique error pattern) ✓
- [x] **OBSV-05**: Cooldown per fingerprint prevents duplicate issues within configurable window ✓
- [x] **OBSV-06**: Creates GitHub issue with agent:builder label when alert passes filters ✓
- [x] **OBSV-07**: Issue body includes severity, release/SHA, environment, repro breadcrumbs (from Sentry event) ✓
- [x] **OBSV-08**: Alert-to-issue correlation: issue links to Sentry event/issue for traceability ✓

## Future Requirements (v1.x+)

- OBSV-09: Multiple Sentry projects or environments with routing rules
- OBSV-10: Persistent cooldown store (e.g., Redis) survives restarts
- OBSV-11: Observability agent metrics
- DEPLOY-04: Staging vs production deploy targets
- DEPLOY-05: Rollback workflow
