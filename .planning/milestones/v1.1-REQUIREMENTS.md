## v1.1 Requirements

### Test Generation

- [x] **TGEN-01**: Builder generates unit tests for all changed files in every PR — Validated
- [x] **TGEN-02**: Generated tests use correct framework (pytest) and project conventions — Validated
- [x] **TGEN-03**: Generated tests are placed in correct directory with correct naming — Validated
- [x] **TGEN-04**: Generated test dependencies are verified (no hallucinated imports) — Validated
- [x] **TGEN-05**: Generated tests pass before PR is finalized — Validated

### PR Promotion

- [x] **PRMO-01**: Draft PR is promoted to ready-for-review when all tests pass — Validated
- [x] **PRMO-02**: Promotion fails gracefully (leave as draft, log error) if API call fails — Validated
- [x] **PRMO-03**: Multi-criteria validation before promotion (tests pass + linting clean) — Validated

## Future Requirements

### Test Backfill

- **TBKF-01**: Builder generates tests for existing v1.0 code retroactively
- **TBKF-02**: Integration tests for cross-component workflows

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| 100% coverage targeting | Over-constrains LLM, diminishing returns |
| Separate test-only LLM call | Context lost, duplicates work — generate tests alongside code |
| Auto-merge PRs | Too dangerous, erodes trust |
| Coverage reporting integration | Nice-to-have, not core to test generation |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| TGEN-01 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| TGEN-02 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| TGEN-03 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| TGEN-04 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| TGEN-05 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| PRMO-01 | Phase 6 | Complete |
