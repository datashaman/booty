## Cross-Phase Integration

| From           | To         | Via                          | Status |
|----------------|------------|------------------------------|--------|
| webhooks.py    | ReviewerQueue | pull_request, ReviewerJob enqueue | ✓ |
| ReviewerQueue  | runner.py  | process_reviewer_job         | ✓ |
| reviewer/runner | checks.py | create_reviewer_check_run, edit_check_run | ✓ |
| reviewer/runner | engine.py | run_review                   | ✓ |
| reviewer/runner | comments.py | post_reviewer_comment      | ✓ |
| verifier/runner | github/checks | reviewer_check_success   | ✓ |
| verifier/runner | reviewer/config | get_reviewer_config, apply_reviewer_env_overrides | ✓ |

## E2E Flows Verified

1. **pull_request → Reviewer run:** Webhook receives opened/synchronize/reopened; enqueues ReviewerJob for agent PRs only; ReviewerQueue dedup + request_cancel on new SHA.
2. **Reviewer → Verifier promotion gate:** Verifier calls reviewer_check_success before promote; Reviewer disabled or success → can_promote; BLOCKED blocks promotion.
3. **Fail-open flow:** LLM/infra exception → edit_check_run success "Reviewer unavailable (fail-open)", increment_reviewer_fail_open, no comment.

## Tech Debt

None reported from phase verifications. No deferred items for v1.9.

## Gaps

None. No critical blockers.
