# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** A Builder agent that can take a GitHub issue and produce a working PR with tested code — the foundation everything else builds on.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: LLM Code Generation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Webhook-to-Workspace Pipeline) — VERIFIED ✓
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase 1 complete, verified (6/6 must-haves)
Last activity: 2026-02-14 — Phase 1 verified, ready for Phase 2

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 25%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Start with Builder only: Avoid protocol/abstraction quicksand; let pain reveal what's needed
- Magentic for LLM abstraction: Decorator-based, type-safe, multi-backend; keeps agent code clean
- GitHub webhooks for triggering: Event-driven is cleaner than polling; integrates with existing workflow
- Fresh clone per task: Isolation prevents stale state leaking between tasks; simplicity over speed
- Label-based issue filtering: Not every issue should trigger a build; explicit opt-in via label
- Pydantic Settings for config (01-01): Type-safe environment variable validation
- LLM_TEMPERATURE defaults to 0.0 (01-01): Deterministic behavior per REQ-17
- Lazy singleton pattern (01-01): @lru_cache on get_settings() for test overrides
- HMAC verification before JSON parsing (01-02): Raw body must be read first for signature validation
- Delivery ID deduplication with 10k cap (01-02): Set-based tracking prevents unbounded memory growth
- Executor for git clone (01-02): GitPython is synchronous - must run in executor to avoid blocking
- Feature branch naming (01-02): agent/issue-{number} provides clear identification
